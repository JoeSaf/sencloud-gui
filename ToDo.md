I need you to improve the aesthetic consistency and functionality of my SenKloud media server web application. Please maintain the existing UI design language while implementing these specific improvements:

**CRITICAL: Maintain the original UI aesthetic - don't completely redesign, just enhance and fix**

## **Issues to Fix:**

### 1. **Upload Page Enhancement**
- Keep the original upload UI design and layout
- Integrate thumbnail upload functionality seamlessly into the existing design
- Ensure the upload process works smoothly with proper error handling
- Maintain the current visual style and color scheme

### 2. **Gallery Page Redesign** 
- The current Gallery.tsx looks clunky and needs updating
- Fix the navbar dynamic functionality that isn't working properly
- Ensure responsive design works across all devices
- Improve the media grid layout and card designs
- Keep the overall aesthetic but make it more polished

### 3. **Cloud Storage Integration**
- Implement a system that scans all present media items and writes them to JSON format in a tree structure
- Set up automatic rescanning every 60 minutes
- Use this data to power the "Recently Added" section
- **IMPORTANT**: The "Recently Added" section should ONLY show video format files

### 4. **Thumbnail Upload Improvements**
- Make the folder thumbnail upload feature more convenient and aesthetically pleasing
- Hide the current thumbnail upload interface
- Create it as a popup/modal that appears when clicking a button
- Place this popup button next to the "View All" button
- Ensure the popup design matches the overall app aesthetic

## **Design Requirements:**
- Maintain the existing dark theme and color palette
- Keep the current typography and spacing
- Preserve the Netflix/Apple TV inspired aesthetic
- Ensure all new components match the existing design language
- Make all interactions smooth and intuitive
- Maintain accessibility standards

## **Technical Requirements:**
- Use TypeScript and React
- Maintain the existing component structure where possible
- Ensure proper error handling and loading states
- Keep the current API integration patterns
- Make the code maintainable and well-documented

## **Priority Order:**
1. Fix navbar functionality and Gallery layout
2. Implement cloud scanning and JSON tree structure
3. Improve thumbnail upload UX
4. Enhance upload page integration
5. Overall aesthetic consistency pass

Please analyze the current codebase and implement these improvements while preserving the existing design aesthetic that works well.

I need a unified Python launcher script for my SenKloud media server application. I have a Flask backend and a React/Vite frontend that I currently run separately. 

Please create a single `app.py` script that:

1. **Starts both servers simultaneously**: 
   - Flask backend server (typically on port 5000)
   - React/Vite frontend dev server (typically on port 5173)

2. **Handles process management**:
   - Runs both servers in separate threads/processes
   - Gracefully shuts down both when the script is terminated
   - Monitors both processes and restarts if one crashes

3. **Provides helpful features**:
   - Automatically opens the browser to the frontend URL
   - Shows colored console output to distinguish backend/frontend logs
   - Checks for dependencies (Node.js, npm, Python packages)
   - Displays startup status and URLs

4. **Directory structure**:
   - Assumes the script is in the root directory
   - Backend code is in current directory or ./backend/
   - Frontend code is in ./frontend/ or current directory
   - Automatically detects the structure

5. **Cross-platform compatibility**:
   - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - Handles different terminal capabilities
   - Uses appropriate commands for each OS

6. **Error handling**:
   - Clear error messages if dependencies are missing
   - Graceful failure if ports are already in use
   - Instructions for common setup issues

The goal is to have one simple command (`python app.py`) that starts my entire development environment. Make it user-friendly for both developers and non-technical users.
